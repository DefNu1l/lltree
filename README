lltree: Enhanced Tree Listing
==============================

The lltree command, a fusion of the tree and ll (long listing) 
commands, is designed to provide an extended and comprehensive 
view of the file structure. This project aims to augment the tree 
command by incorporating additional details such as file 
permissions, user information, and creation dates. By doing so, it 
offers a swift and dependable solution for visualizing folder
contents while ensuring no crucial elements are overlooked.

One of the notable features of lltree is its ability to present 
a clear file structure without requiring administrative privileges. This
makes it accessible to all users, providing a seamless experience 
without any compatibility issues.
